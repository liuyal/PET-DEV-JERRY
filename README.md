## Description

Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder which impairs a person’s ability for social interaction, communication and other cognitive abilities [1]. In order to help autistic patients  improve their social interactions, ***P.E.T. (Personal Emotion Trainer)*** was created. P.E.T. is a behavioral training mobile game designed to teach autistic patients about the basics of facial expressions and emotions to help them develop better social cognitive abilities. P.E.T features multiple training/game modes which involves the player recognizing pictures, videos, or cartoon of an expression or social situation and having them label it. The mechanism used to label the emotional will be designed around the capabilities of the patient. As a behavioral training program, this application is designed to teach the fundamentals of facial expressions and the emotions behind those expression through the mobile device. It will help patients with autism to better understand and identify emotions and therefore improve their social behavior.
